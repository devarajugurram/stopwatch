# stopwatch
### It is a basic stopwatch built using android studio with java programming Language.
### I have imported all basic files needed for the application building.
### ```I have used threads for the time calculation and attached the calculated value to the texview datatype of layout.```
### we can see a basic interface in ```activity_main.xml``` file.
### For logo of the application i have used ```Image Asset ``` and for other icons i used ```vector assets``` which are built in android studio.
### It is least compitable for ```Nougat 7.0``` android version.
